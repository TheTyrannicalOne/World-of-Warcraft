# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.9.11](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.9.11) (2022-10-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.9.10...SL-2.9.11) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Functional changes

- Adjusted 'Lore' tooltip text to be a slightly darker blue to make it distinct from custom Descriptions (will probably be adjusted in future). Just a reminder that you can disable Lore text but still have helpful descriptions enabled, check it in Settings!
- Automatic expansion of groups will no longer expand Difficulty headers (doesn't affect when clicking the groups manually).
- Reverted logic that moves Common Boss Drops and Zone Drops in minilists. This is compensated by those respective headers no longer being automatically expanded inside instances due to the 'Expand Current Difficulty' option.


### Data fixes

- You can get the Shrouded Banner of the Opportune toy again if you missed it during The Great Push SL Season 4. Check out [Raider.IO's Break the Meta](https://raider.io/news/403-break-the-meta-s4-arrives-october-4th) event!
- **Professions updates** (most of these are only updates of content from Classic up to WotLK): gathering professions (+Mining/Skinning BfA Quests), Alchemy, Tailoring (up to Cataclysm), Cooking, Engineering, Enchanting, Leatherworking, Blacksmithing.
- Ongoing adjustments to Achievements, this time around in the Exploration category.
- Updated Wintergrasp.
- Fixed a bunch of Northrend vendors.
- Fixed lots of duplicate quests.
- Other fixes.
