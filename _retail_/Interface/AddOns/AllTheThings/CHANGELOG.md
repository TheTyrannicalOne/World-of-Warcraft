### Highlight of this update

- We finally have Soulbind Conduits tracking! Just the base rank is enough to mark it collected.

### Notable changes:

- Map popouts won't have `Source(s)` header anymore
- Fixed bug with `/attwq` where the window would break
- Added Dalaran to show in `/attwq` properly
- Fixed Benthic tokens to act as Bind-on-Account
- Re-re-added the auto-filling of recursive Purchases under 'cost' Things when visible in a minilist (Minilist or popout) up to 2 levels deep
- Fixed Vignette group text (maybe for the last time, maybe not, idk)
- Fixed missing Highmountain
- Moved 'Debug Mode' checkbox into the 'Features' tab with the rest of the 'Debugging' toggles
- Slight adjustment to Quest Completion logic to not consider alt-collected Quests as completed for a character if in a Party Sync session & Account-Wide Quests disabled
- Re-designed some of the logic for 'Nested Quest Chain Requirements' generation to better reflect the current character's requirements to reach the initial popout quest
- More rare/Adventure drops, treasure/rare coordinates/descriptions, recipes, dailies, new Campaign chapters, etc
- Various fixes
