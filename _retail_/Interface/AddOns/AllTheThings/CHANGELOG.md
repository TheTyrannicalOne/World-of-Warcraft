### Functional changes

- Some further adjustments to inaccurate quest check/report
  - Instantly-completed quests should not trigger the report... hopefully
  - Report dialog now includes if the character has previously completed the quest, and currently-known Professions
- Adjusted some logic that should greatly reduce frame stutter when changing through certain Zones.
- Adjusted auto-filling of Creatures within ATT windows to include Things which are listed under the 'Drops' Header and tagged for the specific Creature (i.e. Rares which drop shared Items).

### Functional fixes

- Fixed some Headers becoming something else entirely.


### Data additions/fixes

- Usual updates to Dragonflight Professions, (World/Weekly) Quests, Renown activities, Rares, Treasures.
- Some attempts to fix sourceQuests on various quests which are immediately available to alts on accounts with completed DF campaigns.
- Other fixes.
