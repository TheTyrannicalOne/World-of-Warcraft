### Highlights of this update

#### Winter Veil (fixes) ðŸŽ„

Yes, more fixes again!

- "New Year Celebrations!" marked as a one-time quest (but look out if it actually is on the 31st).
- Fixed some wrong quests, removed some removed from game quests.
- Added new toy, heirloom and achievement.
- Added Hearthstations and Greatfather Winter's Hearthstone to the Stolen Present.
- Stolen Present drops for lvl 50+ this year! (It was only 60s last year)

Have a nice New Year, everyone! ðŸŽ…

#### Warlords of Draenor quests

Added/fixed and moved lots of WoD quests.

#### Big Chinese localization update

Thanks to @adavak!

### Notable changes:

- Fixed Kyrian Path of Ascension Crafting causing error.
- Items which are collectible by being related to Factions now show properly for certain Factions in some situations (i.e. Scryer/Aldor items when not using Account-wide reputations or only exalted with one faction).
- Adjusted collectible logic for Recipes to additionally check if the current character knows the respective recipe group if Account-Wide collection for Recipes is not active (since you can only collect recipes for professions you currently know if you only expect to collect on the current character).
- SL World Bosses will now show the Common Boss Drops in ATT windows as well (i.e. Alpaca Soul/Conduits showing in `/attwq`).
- New druid form glyphs added to the Inscription craftables (and odd one out quest in Stormwind).
- Added Blinky, new shop pet pet.
- Fixed Firelands Tier Tokens N/H so that they don't cross mingle without regard to their difficulty differences.
- Other fixes.
