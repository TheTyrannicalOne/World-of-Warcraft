[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.6.10...SL-2.6.11) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Vignette tracking üîç

Added some logic concerning Vignette handling, such that Treasures/Rares which become visible on the map in some way will show an additional icon in the respective ATT window (i.e. wondering if that Secret Treasure in Revendreth is actually one you need? Now you will know which one 'specifically' is available [once you travel to Revendreth at least]).

### Notable changes:

- 'Warn Completed Difficulty' should be a little smarter now! Won't tell you to switch to removed difficulties or difficulties that don't have anything for your filters. And it should work with vanilla instances too!
- Fixed the minilist putting difficulty headers within non-instance content (i.e. when a quest within a dungeon difficulty is started outside of the Dungeon it will no longer show within the difficulty outside the dungeon).
- Adjusted Adamant Vaults drops since all bosses share a loot table.
- New store mount! Water kitty!
- Added some missing quests/fixed some quests that were marked as repeatable.
- Some syncing of TBC content.
- Small adjustments in Classic zones.
- Other fixes.
