### Notable changes:

- Huge clean up and improvement to common sorting logic in ATT. From personal experience, this reduces the loading time of the Main ATT window using Simple Dynamic categories by about 50%.
- Items should now also show a special arrow indicator (in ATT windows) if they trigger a once-per-account quest which is not yet completed.
- Force Refresh will now additionally check if any once-per-account quests are completed by the current character (in case they didn't register correctly when ATT loads).
- Supposedly fixed Lua error that might happen sometimes on minilist load when moving between zones.
- Battle Pets and Flight Paths top level groups will now sort properly by Name.
- Ongoing synchronization between Retail and Classic ATT versions.
- Achievement 'To All The Squirrels I've Loved and Lost' cleaned up properly.
- Necrolord Abomination Factory quests should properly show as 'weekly' now.
- More quest fixes.
- Other fixes.
