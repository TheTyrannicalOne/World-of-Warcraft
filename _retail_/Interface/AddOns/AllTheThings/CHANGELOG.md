### Hightlight of this update

PvP filter is finally here! ðŸ™Œ

All transmog, achievements and other things should be hidden behind the PvP toggle (on the main page of settings).

### Smaller changes

- Misc filter was removed and force enabled for everyone
- Fixed Collected icon in tooltips on 'Collected' Appearances in Unique Mode
- Numerous fixes for things that are cost for other things
- Put more things behind Covenants filter
- Fixes to PvP ensembles/vendors
- Did you know we have `/att random` (or just `/att rand`) command? Now you know, go try it! Fixed this thing for Russian and Chinese clients
- Lots of Legion quests additions
- Usual fixes here and there, see full list above

P.S. `/att random` was broken only in Russian and Chinese because only these two languages have good localization in ATT. If you want to break a feature or two while also bringing this addon to more users in your native tongue, reach out to us on Discord!
