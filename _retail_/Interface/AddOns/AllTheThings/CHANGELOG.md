### Fearless Spectator
Watch Global Finals for AWC and MDI to get new title and achievement. This is a time limited event. More info [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23823096/watch-the-mdi-awc-shadowlands-global-finals-and-earn-the-fearless-spectator-title).


### Notable changes:

- Fixed a Lua bug when opening a Profession window which has no corresponding content sourced in ATT.
- Minilist/popouts will fill in properly now (Creation Catalyst class groupings, etc).
- Fixed Dynamic Azerite Essences to work properly with multiple ranks per essence.
- Fixed Simple Dynamic categories to take into account that some Things have multiple sources.
- Azerite Essences and Followers now show their 'Source(s)' when popped out via right-click/command search.
- Fixed Followers loading crashing the game for now (but they don't have fancy Model tooltips until the root issue can be addressed).
- Battle Pets learned from Items will now show as the Item in ATT lists and tooltips while those caught in open world will remain as the current blue text.
- The 'Group Finder' header in `/attwq` will now only show categories which meet the level range for your current character, unless in Account/Debug modes.
- Fixed unobtainable Things slipping through filters and appearing in Dynamic Categories.
- Adjusted the background of the Retail ATT window scrollbar to match the Settings scrollbars and give better indication that there is a scrollframe available.
- Testing out hiding the scrollbar of a Retail ATT window if there's not enough visible rows to require any scrolling.
- Lots of achievements updated to the current standards of representation.
- Various zones synchronized with ATT Classic: Undercity, Hillsbrad Foothills, Stranglethorn Vale.
- Other fixes.
