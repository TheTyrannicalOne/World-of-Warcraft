Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* added logic 'Custom Collectibility' which can be used to define character-specific requirements which are one-time or specifically modify a character's capability to collect Quests - added Custom Collectibility for the New Player Experience -- Exile's Reach - added tooltip information with localization for Custom Collectibility of Things to make it clear why a Thing may not actually be considered Collectible for the current character - fixed bug which caused collections to refresh infinitely when the addon version is changed (fixes #631) - added Parser handling for new source data tag: "customCollect" - slight cleanup to the update groups logic - moved the late location trigger to hopefully catch some situations where the current instance window still loads the continent data instead of map data... ugh
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings - reparsed
* removed arbitrary achievement from the Achievements > PvP category - removed arbitrary icon from Factions > Guild category
* added option to Show/Hide the percentage completion of a row
* modified API harvester to only store repeatable OR daily flags for quests since API likes to return daily as well for some repeatable quests, which doesnt make sense
* some unused code trying to figure out a way to do API harvest more efficiently - API harvest updates for 2020-11-23 Items/Quests
* fixed parser where level data was dropped for unsorted quests - fixed parser to put items with lvl > 50 into the Shadowlands tier of unsorted instead of BFA

* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings
* added Shadowlands to /attwq

* fixed 'Toggle Debug' keybind not performing the same functionality as clicking the settings Debug Mode checkbox - slightly improved performance of toggling Debug Mode on
* fixed questID 55629 for Uldum Assault - refactored a lot of world quest list logic to be better in general and more consistent - re-arranged priority on world quest list zones to order by how recently they were added to the game

* added mapID to 'De Other Side'
* removed "Not available in Personal Loot" except from items with a SourceID
