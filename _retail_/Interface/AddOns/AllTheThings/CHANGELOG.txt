Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* fixed name of variable within function a() - moved the stack count check outside of the loop running the stack functions - simplified the logic check for adding the OnUpdate script trigger - modified WorldQuests:Clear() to Update the window but not also trigger a Rebuild() - unutilized variable 'retry' in WorldQuests:Rebuild() will now track whether the Rebuild should be re-tried instead of immediately returning for any missing API data (this completely eliminates the refresh stuttering/persistent lag when refreshing the /attwq window during an active faction invasion) - added a 'Clear World Quests' button to the /attwq list when it becomes populated (this is nice for when the settings of 'treat currencies as containers' is toggled off, since that will not remove currencies from /attwq otherwise, plus Clear() was never being used, so now it has a purpose)
* added source quests for garrison stables quests (#508)
* fixed alignment of collection ATT icons in data rows due to how alignment is handled by the Client for textures - spec icons are sorted properly in data rows
* removed logic that prevented repeatable quests from being considered collectible when toggled to be treated as such
* added a blue version of the 'X' icon to allow for a distinction between "not collected" things and "visible, non-collectible" things - modified repeatable quest entries to have a blue icon preview instead of the yellow icon (assuming a provider model is not shown instead)
* modified logic for recursive expand/collapse so that it works based on any subgroup rather than only the first subgroup (this allows the world quest list to be recursively collapsed finally)
* fixed unobtainable indexes when an old unobtainable value is referenced in the data
* fixed obsolete unobtainable indexes in data
* fixed obsolete unobtainable indexes in zhCN locale file
* modified how spec information is retrieved for Things so that filtering logic is consolidated and performed efficiently - added logic to add spec information for Legion and BFA rings/necks so that personal loot drop chances are properly determined - modified calculations for legacy/personal loot drop chances
* consolidated a lot of world quest/quest object logic to ensure that quests are loaded/populated consistently - added Storyline data retrieval into the World Quests window IF Quest tracking or Debug is enabled - added additional Continent MapIDs for the Storyline support
* slight adjustment to position of the 'Track Repeatable Quests' since it does not rely on 'Show Incomplete Things' - fixed unobtainable logic since it changed the dynamic unobtainables settings menu - added consolidated function for obtaining a MapObject for the world quest Rebuild() function - quest names are now attempted to pull into initial questObjects if immediately available - cached C_Map.GetMapInfo() since it is used rather often - modified group visibility filtering to accurately show/hide groups based on 'Show Incomplete Things' showing incomplete things within completed groups - modified tooltip progress text to properly indicate whether the Thing is 'Collectible/Collected' vs. 'Trackable/Completed' - fixed potential GroupFinder logic variable reference - modified the world quest list to sort the groups of each top-level group by raid,quest,map,level and then by name (if existing) within each category
* fixed world bosses showing as their world quest - fixed world quest sorting map groups
* fixed 'Non-Collectible, Completed' Things from sticking around in a list when becoming Completed
* modified Debug to properly ignore 'Show Incomplete Things' and 'Filter Things By Level' settings (i.e. show everything regardless of completion state and required level) - fixed provider for #48492 'Getting a Leg Up' (creature ID changes from picking up to completion of quest)
* actually fixed Debug... - only set parent visibilty based on Incomplete tracking of a child if the parent is not already visible
* text for 'Show Collected Things' was the same as 'Show Completed Groups'
* fixed visibility toggling on Complete Groups which contain Incomplete Things while 'Show Incomplete Things' is enabled
* added capability of marking Items as Saved based on an AchievementID which is useful for Items have a QuestID attached but also unlock an Account-Wide AchievementID which prevents them from being obtained on any other characters on the Account (Shipyard Blueprints from Tanaan Jungle for instance) - removed duplicated Equipment Blueprints from Tanaan Zone Drops - tagged Tanaan Jungle/HFC Equipment Blueprints with respective hidden AchievementIDs
* re-added equipment blueprints to zone drops in Tanaan since they have a very slim chance to also drop from random rares
* removed individual tagging of once-per-account Item drops via achievementID - added garrison shipyard equipment to the allied race section of manually flagging questIDs based on achievementID completion for the account
* added metadata files for new darkshore and darkshore warfront content - removed duplicated information from non-metadata files - removed random unrelated achievements from various warfront headers - added mapIDs for darkshore warfront (not up currently so can't really test, but based on discord map reports/github issues for the scenario)
* show a bit more character info in the character tooltip in the Debug main list - wrap tooltips which show more than 4 race requirements
* modified /attwq so that things which are available but not time-limited are able to be queried separately (i.e. Heroic Deeds & Available Map Quests currently)
* moved heroic deeds logic out of the per-mapID loop since it snuck in while i wasn't looking
* removed Horde/Alliance text from Faction ID tooltip line
* Legion: Balance of Power Updates (#539)
