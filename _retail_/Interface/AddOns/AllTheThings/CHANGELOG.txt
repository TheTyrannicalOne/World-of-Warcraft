* converted Garrison > Trading Post > AH Quest/Item to utilize 'cost' instead of nesting/tagging items required for the quest - removed modID from various Alliance Lunarfall Inn daily quests which somehow breaks the Contains functionality on the Horde versions of the reward containers... - fixed tooltip Progress on Toys - fixed building empty Currency groups - modified symlinks to always return cloned objects so that they cannot modify the Source structure - modified Search/Contains logic to ensure only cloned objects are returned in the final result so that they cannot modify the Source structure
* changed logic to clone data instead of creating identical objects (it was probably copying the actual source groups for things like .parent every time a new minilist was generated, etc. thus eventually leading to stack overflows when changing zones enough..?)
* modified CreateObject to utilize CloneData if it is trying to create an object which is already an object - some comments for places where CreateObject is no longer necessary to call because it's being called earlier in the logic
* actually finished campaign mission as Venthyr LOL what a scuffed set of companions...
