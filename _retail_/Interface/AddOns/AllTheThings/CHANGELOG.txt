Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* BoEs which are NYI will show the red unobtainable circle instead of green
* added all known costs (Tier 2) for abom stitching table cosmetic crafts/unlocks - customCollect requirements will now show on Contains rows if required
* added item costs for the 'Crypt Couture' achievement - flipped heirarchy of 'It's in the Mix' from Ach > Crit > NPC to Ach > NPC > Crit to easier show which NPCs are available to be killed - inferred remaining adv campaign HQTs based on the incremental pattern of questIDs (waiting to find out ONE of them is not actually sequential because blizzard)
* got rid of the evil default dropdown and put in some pseudo-radio buttons to allow for selecting the tooltip modifier key (fixes #656) - tooltip modifier key now affects NPC hover tooltips as well (since tooltips do not refresh by default, pressing the mod key while the tooltip is open will not adjust the tooltip until hovering) - fixed a couple locale keys/values
* fixed a global-defined function
* missing map in torghast
* another (last?) adv cache
* fixed/added references for 'The Great Luckydo'
