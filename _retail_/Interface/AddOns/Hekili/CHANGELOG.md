[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/compare/v8.3.0-04-18...v8.3.0-04-19)

- WW:  If we just cast Tiger Palm but we refreshed before the Chi was generated, fake it.  
- Don't call table.wipe unless we need to.  
- Clear target cycling data for each test.  
- More WW tweaking.  
- More WW revisions to avoid recommendation blocking due to Mastery/Hit Combo and ending a fight with TP.
