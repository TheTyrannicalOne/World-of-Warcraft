- Balance:  Fix ap\_check (which was preventing Incarnation).  
- Make action pack export string window bigger.  
- Load after ElvUI (we may need to skin our boxes).  
- Enable ElvUI skinning for the custom editor for conditions.  
- Use common hostile unitIDs to filter out targets counted by damage if we care about range and we know they're out of range.
