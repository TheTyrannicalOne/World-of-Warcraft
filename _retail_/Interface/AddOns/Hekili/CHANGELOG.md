[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/compare/v9.0.5-1.0.3...v9.0.5-1.0.4) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases)

- Frost Mage:  Remove unnecessary 'wait' expression.  
- Prevent another pooling error.  
- Don't force updates on every SPELL\_DAMAGE event (was resulting in more forced updates on asynchronous AOE).  
- Marksmanship:  Update APL.  
- Unholy:  Use Outbreak when new targets arrive.  
- Feral:  Update APL.  
- Make cast-while-channeling spells require a *little* time left on the channel.
