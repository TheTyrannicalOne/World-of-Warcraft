[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/compare/v9.0.2-1.0.22...v9.0.2-1.0.23) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases)

- Don't treat Mindbender as a CD by default (CD is only 60 seconds).  
- Notify WeakAuras when we profile swap.  
- Profiles can be swapped by command-line or macro.  
- Enhancement Shamans should refresh Windfury Totem if they outrange it, even with Doom Winds.  
- Arms:  Update priority to use Sweeping Strikes with Ravager.  
- Subtlety:  Make variable.use\_priority\_rotation available sooner; tweak APL to reduce reprocessing of finish list.  
- Maaaybe don't show GCD on off-GCD abilities.  Maybe.  
- Restore Pummel to Arms priority.  
- Create a warning if GET\_ITEM\_INFO\_RECEIVED fails for something we asked for.  
- Tweak Shadow to handle multidotting (+Void Torrent) when forcing ST vs. AOE.
