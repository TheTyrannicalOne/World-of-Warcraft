- Update options  
- ThroneOfThunder/Jinrokh: Remove the "Static Wound Conduction" functionality. This used to be a warning for the tank with Static Wound, to tell them they were standing in the water, because it would conduct and damage other players. This no longer seems to be a feature of this boss. It was either removed intentionally or accidentally by Blizzard sometime after the expansion became old content. Closes #21
