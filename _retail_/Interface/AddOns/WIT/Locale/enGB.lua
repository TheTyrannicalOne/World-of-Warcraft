Cons - items you need to define price sources for those items that'd be always used by this addon. You need to have all materials you can loot before the farm (or you can have a break to configure custom prices as soon as you loot those items). The trick is that items with custom price source configurated are recorded regardless of your min quality/min price settings for Recorder. Go to Configuration -> Custom Prices. Drop items that you want to record onto the empty slot. If you leave the default value (empty price source), your default price source will be used for that item. If you want to set a different price souce, you can select Edit from the context menu and enter a valid TSM price source. Then go to Configuration -> Recorder and set Min Quality to Rare or Epic (common/uncommon materials with a custom price will be recorder anyway)."
L["TricksGuideSection_7"] = "The second option requires a Scrap addon.
