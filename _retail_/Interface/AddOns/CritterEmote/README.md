WoW Addon Chinchilla Critter Emote

This addon will have your non-combat pets do fun and random things.

When you have a pet out every so often  it will emote something fun.  You can also have your pets become more interactive by having them emote custom actions by using /ce instead of /emote.

Your pets will also now respond to the in game emotes.  Try /wave at your pet.

Your pet will do an emote between five and ten minutes as long as you are not in combat.
They might just do something different as well if you have something targeted.

If you find any typos, or mistakes please let me know and i'll fix them.

If you would like to add your own emotes edit the file CritterEmote_Emotes.lua
If you send them to me I'll add them into the main release :)

Usage:
/ce - have your critter perform a random emote.
/ce <message> - have your critter emote your <message>.
/ce [options] - perform the various option:
[options] =
info  : displays Critter Emote information.
help  : displays this help.
off   : turns the random emote off.
on    : turns the random emotes back on.

If you have any ideas for new emotes please let me know.
Currently emotes can be in the following category:

Default - for all critters
type - subtype of critter ( cat )
name - specific pet ( Lil' K.T. )

Under each category there is 
emote - such as /cry or /wave
random - anything
target - if something is targeted
