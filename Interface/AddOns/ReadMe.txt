 Installation Information 
==================== 

Extract all files to your root World of Warcraft folder. By default, the installation path is C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\

Any foldername starting with "##RENAME##" is a VARIABLE folder name that you must rename to the value described in the current folder name. If you do not correctly edit the couple/few folders starting with "##RENAME##" then ZerkinUI will not work. 

If any of you guys have problems installing this you can contact me via rypedesigns@gmail.com, replying to my thread on the official WoW Shaman forums, or you may whisper me @ Zerkin-Illidan, of course US. I don't mind if you spread this around, just please give credit where due to my custom WeakAuras, and do not take makeshift ownership of them. That is all I ask ... thank you all for your interest in ZerkinUI!

 About Zerkin-Illidan 
==================== 

!! UPDATE !! -- As of 02.06.2017 Zerkin is officially homeless, living out of his car and accessing the internet only through his phone. He will still use any time he has at his PC, which is being stored at parent's house, to keep my additions to the WoW community current and updated. If you wish to support Zerkin financially, the donation info can be found at the bottom of this description. 

ZerkinUI is a created by Zerkin, a day 1 Classic resident of US-Illidan. I was first known as Anderthall, an Undead Mage, then Deoxis, an Orc Shaman on which I played in Paranoia - who directly competed with Blood Legion and Team Ice in Sunwell. 



======================================== 
 ZerkinUI Objective, String Elements, Info 
======================================== 

It was designed with a Web 2.0 Minimalist design in mind, and everything is arranged to optimize player efficiency to the highest possible level. This was accomplished through the utilization of modern UI design standards, as well as implementing information regarding the human brain/eye and it's limited capabilities in peripheral vision and multi-tasking. 

ZerkinUI is an all-in-one UI that was originally designed to be downloaded in it's entirety via a .rar/.zip archive. That version can be downloaded here:

For portability I have made all of the exportable/importable elements of ZerkinUI available publicly at the ZerkinUI Collection page, accessed here:

The UnitFrame texture seen in these screenshots was also created by me, and can be downloaded here:

 How to Support ZerkinUI 
========================= 

!! ZerkinUI literally took upwards of 100 hours of fairly intense thought & effort worth of programming, drafting, and designing up to this point. That may sound crazy, but that includes the time it took for me to learn basic LUA scripting, as well as the time and effort associated with conceiving+coding+testing every WeakAura. I even conceived/drafted/tested 6 entirely different ElvUI layouts, all of which were made from my own mind and without external inspiration, in order to achieve this first official release. !! 

!! If you wish to support or show your appreciation for the effort involved in the creation of ZerkinUI, you may do so by sending your support by PayPal to RypeDesigns@gmail.com - anything is greatly appreciated! !!

Thanks in advance, 
Ryan "Zerkin" Perkins
